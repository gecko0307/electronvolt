<h1>Cook</h1>
<p>Cook is a tool for building projects in <a href="http://dlang.org">D programming language</a>.</p>
<p>Requires no configuration file - it automatically collects information about source code from the *.d files in project directory. Cook is written in D2/Phobos and currently supports Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>To determine which module needs recompiling, Cook traces dependencies between all of them. To do this properly, it performs lexical analyzis, which is a 
relatively expensive procedure. But, actually, it's not neccessary to always do full scanning, except the very first time. Build writes all metadata into 
cache file, and then uses it, invoking lexer only for modules that has changed, and those which depend on them. A process is a kind of chain reaction - if a module needs recompiling, everything that rely on it also needs recompiling, and so on. This approach is especially useful in compilcated template-based 
environments.</p>
