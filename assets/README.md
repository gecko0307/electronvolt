# Assets

To run Electronvolt, you'll need binary data which is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RbZPQ-sSfckf9nT6jGagbqBsn3YwCV4T/view?usp=drive_link). Download the archive `eV-0.0.7-assets.7z`, unpack it and put the contents alongside with the executable.

To lighten the updates of the asset archive, the game soundtrack (`assets/music` folder) is downloaded separately. It is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13rnpvkE5LarN8dg_jgjgP4-12Nk639RD/view?usp=sharing). Download the archive `eV-music.7z`, unpack it and put the contents alongside with the executable.
